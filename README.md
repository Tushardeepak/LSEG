# LSEG UI - Chatbot

Here is the deployed link for play around: https://lseg-tushar-deepak.netlify.app/

How to run in local: 

1. Clone the respository in local by running this in local terminal "git clone https://github.com/Tushardeepak/LSEG.git"
2. Head over to cloned project floder and run "npm install"
3. After it finished run "npm start"
4. In browser the app start

The assumption I have made is this chat bot is for 3 stages only (1. Select stock exchange, 2. Select stock name, 3. Get price). If more steps are involved we are extend the current based on that.

# LSEG UI - Chatbot

Here is the deployed link for play around: 

How to run in local: 

1. Clone the respository in local.
2. Head over to project and run "npm install"
3. After it finished run "npm start"
4. In browser the app start

The assumption I have made is this chat bot is for 3 stages only (1. Select stock exchange, 2. Select stock name, 3. Get price). If more steps are involved we are extend the current based on that.
